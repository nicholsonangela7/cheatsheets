# Command line cheatsheet

This is a cheat sheet for "Bourne-again shell" (bash) and GNU/Linux commands.

## Text maninpulation

### Skip the first line of a file

```
tail -n +2 filename.txt
```

## Compressing and decompressing files

### Create a gzipped tarball from a `*` glob command

This will create the gzipped tarball `voyages_different_direction.tar.gz` with everything in my current folder that starts with `voyages_different_direction_`.

* `z` is for "g***z***ip"
* `c` is for "***c***ompress"
* `v` is for "***v***erbose." Show all the files that are getting compressed as it's happening. (Good for debugging)
* `f` is for "***f***ilename." Must be the last flag because the filename is inferred after it

```
tar -zcvf voyages_different_direction.tar.gz voyages_different_direction_*
```

### Decompress a gzipped tarball

The `-` is optional, can also say `tar -xzvf`

* `x` is for "e***x***tract"
* `z` is for "g***z***ip"
* `v` is for "***v***erbose." Show all the files that are getting extracted as it's happening. (Good for debugging)
* `f` is for "***f***ilename." Must be the last flag because the filename is inferred after it

```
tar xzvf voyages_different_direction.tar.gz
```

### Create a zip file

Create a zip file from multiple files

```
zip squash.zip file1 file2 file3
```


## File management

### Soft links

Make a pretend file in a new place that jumps to the old file when you look at it.

```
ln -s oldfile newplace
```

### Hard links

Make a new pointer (aka `inode`) to the same data in the filesystem. If there are multiple pointers to the data, the data is not truly "erased" until the last pointer is removed (i.e. the `inode` number is decremented to 0)

```
ln oldfile newplace
```

### Opening files containing and not containing certain text

Open all files that match this glob command, except if they have `stream` in them.

```
ls -1 exon_3p_exonbody_tier1_*/homerResults.html | grep -v stream | xargs open
```

## Installing programs 

### Python

To install a python program, usually you can use `pip`. I like the `-e` flag, which installs it in "developer mode" because any change in the files located there is also reflected in the imported code.

```
cd python_program/
pip install -e .
```

### From source

To install a program from source on a shared cluster, you will often need to specify the directory you want to install things. That can be done with `--prefix` at the `./configure` step. The directory is where you want all the `bin/`, `lib/` and so on files to be added to (default is `/usr/local`) Then, do `make` and `make install`. For example:

```
./configure --prefix=/projects/ps-yeolab/software
make && make install   # "make install" will run only if "make" is successful
```
